# Markan - Marketing Analytics  
Final Year Project Fall 2018 - Spring 2019

### Introduction  
Social media has turned out to be a very effective way of sharing oneâ€™s opinions with others. Many companies are now running promotional pages to promote their services and products to customers around the globe. They share posts and advertisements on their social media pages, which are widely seen by a variety of people.
The users or potential customers often tend to write comments and show their sentiments about the product that is being advertised.
Companies needs to understand and analyze what people think about their products, and what are their needs. They also want to know how effective their advertising campaigns are and how people react to such posts. This would help the company in making 
better and effective advertising models by using the results of previous advertisements.

### Project modules  
1. The project includes a web portal that allows companies to analyze user sentiments towards their products and services. It takes reviews as input from the Markan Location Based marketing app and other sources, and uses **natural language processing techniques** to extract useful information out of them.  It then displays information about sentiments in form of various graphs and plots making it easier for the marketers to analyze trends.
  
2. The project also consists of a location-based marketing application. A **geo-fence** is created around the user's location and displays stores of different categories that are offering discounts. Users can choose from various categories e.g. shoes, and a list of stores would be shown, that are offering sales. Only those stores will be shown that lie within the specified distance threshold set by the user, such as 5km.
